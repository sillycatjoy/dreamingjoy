      <div class="post"><details><summary>5. 3/15/25 - Making a new page??</summary><p>Hey dreamers! Shorter post today but I wanted to give you all something, even if it's insignificant. I actually wrote a whole blog post here but I didn't like it so I got rid of it XD Right now, i'm working on <a href=/art/>a new page</a> to showcase my art! It's not done yet (as of now i've only finished the background and main div container :P) but I plan on putting some of my art there! I draw quite a bit, mainly at school, and I have stacks of paper in my school binder with just drawing after drawing after drawing, and I wanted to put some on my site! So yeah you'll see that soon :D Anyways byebye love you thanks for reading mwah!!!!!!!!!!</p></details></div>
      <div class="post"><details><summary>4. 3/14/25 - Fun day at school + PI DAY??</summary><p>Hello dreamers at dreamingjoy.ca welcome back!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry for not posting in a while i've been kinda busy XD Anyways happy pi day! Today was a very fun day. There wasn't a big workload and all my friends were there! (Although one had to leave partway through the day unfortunately). In math class today we talked about circles and pi and we had to make the cylinder with the most surface area using an 8x11 inch paper. I think the hypothetical highest surface area you could have would be 88 inches because the surface area of the paper is 88 but I don't know i'm kinda silly so I could be wrong. Anyways after that we ate pie to celebrate pi day but me and my friend has gelatin-free pie and one of them was really good and one was not... Basically there was two slices of gelatin-free pie but both were different flavours so we decided one would have one of the slices while the other would have the other. I was lucky and got the one that was (in my opinion) good, but that unfortunately meant my friend got the weird one :P I actually tried the weird pie and it was unpleasant. Anyways it was still fun and we joked about it together. I also had a really funny time last block because me and my friend were goofing around and we made each other laugh SO HARD. When I got home I played Minecraft with my friend and then watched a movie with my family. It was a good day. :3 I've been very happy lately. Things have been going very well :DD I hope it stays that way!!! Love you all byeeeeeeeeeee <333</p></details></div>
      <div class="post"><details><summary>3. 3/10/25 - Cool artist I found!!</summary><p>Haii dreamers I love you all so much! How are you :D Anyways today I have found a music artist I really like that I want to share with you all! They're not necessarily small or anything (although not big either) and i've been really liking their music! Their name is Kiyosumi and i've listened to quite a few of their songs (just putting their music on shuffle while I scroll pinterest or something like that) and I also listened to their EP "Pathetic". I'm actually listening to one of their songs right now (It's called "thinking of you") and it's super great!! I listen on YouTube music but you can probably listen from other places? Idk but I reccomend them they're really cool!!! Thanks for reading mwah byebye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></details></div>
      <div class="post"><details><summary>2. 3/9/25 - MIKU DAY 2025!!!</summary><p>HELLO!!! Guess what! Today is MIKU DAY! It's miku day because in japanese 3 can be pronounced as "mi" and 9 as "ku" (this is why 39 is the miku number) and today is 3/9!!!!! I'm very happy about this :3 Miku means a lot to me because not only do I like listening to vocaloid music but I feel like she's helped me through shitty times (I know that probably doesn't make sense) and I also think I wouldn't have discovered a lot of things I like if iy weren't for Miku!!! In a weird way, she kind of helped me become who I am?? Idk but I love Miku!!!!!!! I don't have any special plans today but i'm listening to some songs that use Miku's voice as I type this! YAYYYY! Happy Miku Day, stranger reading this :3</p></details></div>
      <div class="post"><details><summary>1. 3/8/25 - My first blog post!!!</summary><p>hii welcome :D in this blog post i want to tell you ALL ABOUT FORSAKEN!! it's this really cool roblox game. basically you play as either a survivor or killer. As a survivor, you need to stay alive until the timer runs out. As a killer, you must kill all the survivors. There are generators around the map, and everytime a generator puzzle is completed, the timer goes down a bit. Meanwhile, everytime a killer kills someone, the timer goes up!!!! Each survivor/killer has their own abilities to help them win too. The coolest part to me is every character is a reference to another roblox thing in some way. I really like playing elliot as a survivor, who is a person from work at a pizza place. He can throw pizzas at people that'll heal them and everytime he does that he gets a charge for an ability called Rush Hour that gives him speed! As a killer, I like c00lkidd, who's a reference to hacker, famous for hacking quite a few games (ironically, work at a pizza place was one of them XD). In the lore, c00lkidd was left on 007n7's (a retired hacker and creator of the c00lgui) doorstep as a pill baby due to his skin condition so 007n7 took him in and raised him as his own. In the forsaken place, c00lkidd actually doesn't even know he's killing people. He's only ten years old!!!! He thinks his sword is a toy and that he's just playing tag, and that the people he kills are just tired from playing. :( Anyways yay forsaken awesome!!!!!!!!!!</p></details></div>
