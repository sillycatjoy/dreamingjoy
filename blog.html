      <div class="post"><details><summary>3. 3/10/25 - Cool artist I found!!</summary><p>Haii dreamers I love you all so much! How are you :D Anyways today I have found a music artist I really like that I want to share with you all! They're not necessarily small or anything (although not big either) and i've been really liking their music! Their name is Kiyosumi and i've listened to quite a few of their songs (just putting their music on shuffle while I scroll pinterest or something like that) and I also listened to their EP "Pathetic". I'm actually listening to one of their songs right now (It's called "thinking of you") and it's super great!! I listen on YouTube music but you can probably listen from other places? Idk but I reccomend them they're really cool!!! Thanks for reading mwah byebye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></details></div>
      <div class="post"><details><summary>2. 3/9/25 - MIKU DAY 2025!!!</summary><p>HELLO!!! Guess what! Today is MIKU DAY! It's miku day because in japanese 3 can be pronounced as "mi" and 9 as "ku" (this is why 39 is the miku number) and today is 3/9!!!!! I'm very happy about this :3 Miku means a lot to me because not only do I like listening to vocaloid music but I feel like she's helped me through shitty times (I know that probably doesn't make sense) and I also think I wouldn't have discovered a lot of things I like if iy weren't for Miku!!! In a weird way, she kind of helped me become who I am?? Idk but I love Miku!!!!!!! I don't have any special plans today but i'm listening to some songs that use Miku's voice as I type this! YAYYYY! Happy Miku Day, stranger reading this :3</p></details></div>
      <div class="post"><details><summary>1. 3/8/25 - My first blog post!!!</summary><p>hii welcome :D in this blog post i want to tell you ALL ABOUT FORSAKEN!! it's this really cool roblox game. basically you play as either a survivor or killer. As a survivor, you need to stay alive until the timer runs out. As a killer, you must kill all the survivors. There are generators around the map, and everytime a generator puzzle is completed, the timer goes down a bit. Meanwhile, everytime a killer kills someone, the timer goes up!!!! Each survivor/killer has their own abilities to help them win too. The coolest part to me is every character is a reference to another roblox thing in some way. I really like playing elliot as a survivor, who is a person from work at a pizza place. He can throw pizzas at people that'll heal them and everytime he does that he gets a charge for an ability called Rush Hour that gives him speed! As a killer, I like c00lkidd, who's a reference to hacker, famous for hacking quite a few games (ironically, work at a pizza place was one of them XD). In the lore, c00lkidd was left on 007n7's (a retired hacker and creator of the c00lgui) doorstep as a pill baby due to his skin condition so 007n7 took him in and raised him as his own. In the forsaken place, c00lkidd actually doesn't even know he's killing people. He's only ten years old!!!! He thinks his sword is a toy and that he's just playing tag, and that the people he kills are just tired from playing. :( Anyways yay forsaken awesome!!!!!!!!!!</p></details></div>
