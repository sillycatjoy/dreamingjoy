      <!-- the stuff above me is the title and stuff. if you're wondering "why is joy putting comments all the sudden" it's cause i'm in a cs class at school and when we were doing p5.js we were graded on our comments as well. i realized how much easier your code is to debug when you have actual comments. but when i get into the "zone" and i'm just typing away there won't be as much fyi -->

            <p>Hai! I'm Joy, the silly teenager behind dreamingjoy.ca! I go by she/her. I'm very bad at writing about me sections. Like, genuinely terrible. I like video games, YouTube, TV shows, and all of the sorts. I really like roblox (although the roblox corporation is kind of ass let's be real.) but I really like those games like regretevator and phighting and stuff. My favourite regretevator NPC is partynoob. I really like vocaloid and the such too. My favourite vocaloid is Hatsune Miku. (I know i'm very generic with my choices. Please don't shoot me dead) Webshows are cool too. Murder Drones is SO lovely and is one of my favourite TV shows of all time. BFDI is also good, but my favourite object show is ONE by CheesyHFJ. I particularly like how much more story-oriented it is. As for "real" TV shows, Mr. Robot is probably another one of my favourites. Severance is really good too. I know this is like a copy of my old about me, but I also really like Station Eleven. I don't read too much, but I really like this webcomic called I love amy. It's what I call LOVELYCORE. YAY!!!</p>
